# Introduction
This project consists of two notebooks that are using the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language.
Some physics background is provided in the first notebook.

In the notebook [fbs.ipynb](fbs.ipynb) we want to discuss a way to determine a specific parameter for numerical simulation.
This procedure has been used to determine numerical parameters for simulations with a bigger Julia program (may be added to this repo at some later stage).

The results of those simulations are a large number of .csv files and in the data folder there is a small sample set of the data.
The notebook [evaluation.ipynb](evaluation.ipynb) explaines how to read these data files and perform a typical analysis.

The full results are currently being used to prepare a manuscript.

# Running the notebooks
If you don't want to install anything you can simply use the following binder link (note that the interactive plot does not work in Binder): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/teokem/project-work-2021-si8881wo/HEAD)

To run it locally on your computer simply download this repo and unzip it.
I'm assuming you have a conda installation and can run jupyter notebook.
Install Julia (download it from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions.), if you haven't already and make sure to add the kernel to jupyter notebook (instructions for example [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)).

Open a jupyter notebook instance as usual and whenever you start one of the notebooks the Project.toml (and Manifest.toml) should be detected automatically (corresponds to environments in python).
 

# Used Julia Packages
* [Plots](http://docs.juliaplots.org): for plotting, similar to matplotlib in python (has several backends e.g. GR, PyPlot, plotly and several more)
* [StatsPlots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl): extends the Plots package for common statistics plots and contains plot recepies for DataFrames
* [Interact](https://juliagizmos.github.io/Interact.jl/latest/): for interactive plot widgets, sliders, etc.
* [WebIO](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/WebIO.jl): not explicitly loaded, but needed for interactive plots
* [LaTeXStrings](https://github.com/stevengj/LaTeXStrings.jl): for LaTeX type setting in the plot labels
* [CSV](https://csv.juliadata.org/stable/): library to handle .csv files
* [DataFrames](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/): package for handling datasets (similar to pandas for python)
* [Statistics](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Statistics/): standard library for statistics operations like for example mean values
* [LinearAlgebra](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/): standard library for linear algebra operations like for example eigenvalues
